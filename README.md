# Pump-it-Up-Data-Mining-the-Water-Table
The availability of clean drinking water is a
significant issue that affects public health and socioeconomic
development in many parts of the world. This research employs
machine learning techniques to predict Tanzanian water
pumps operational state by using the "Pump It Up" dataset
from the Taarifa waterpoint mapping platform. using more
than 59,000 water points in the dataset. Numerous features,
including location, installation specifics, type of water source,
and pump characteristics, are included in the dataset.

The study looks at different approaches for preprocessing and
analyzing data in order to create precise classification models
that can recognize pumps that aren't working. Utilizing data
cleaning and feature engineering techniques, strategies are
investigated for dealing with missing values, outliers, and
categorical variables. Additionally, in order to predict the water
pump status (functional, non-functional, or functional needs
repair), the predictive performance of several machine learning
algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random
forests, and gradient boosting, was trained and evaluated.

Results indicate that ensemble techniques such as random
forests and gradient boosting outperform other algorithms in
predicting pump functionality. The best-performing model
achieved an accuracy of 81% and a balanced accuracy of 67%
in classifying the water pump status.

Government officials and development organizations can use
the knowledge gathered from this study to prioritize
interventions and investments aimed at enhancing water access
and reliability in Tanzania and other comparable regions. The
study's findings provide important insights into the factors that
impact water pump functionality. The generated predictive
models can also be used to find at-risk water locations and direct
targeted maintenance and repair activities.
